I enjoyed this lab. I got to use functions and how to define them here.
My biggest challenge with this lab was trying to understand if I was going to need a parameter when using the new_game function.
I didn't know how to properly lay out this code at first either. it took a bit of brainstorming and it paid off.
Regardless, I think that this is a great project, and probably my favorite coding project that we've done so far.
